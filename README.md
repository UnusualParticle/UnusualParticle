## Greetings

Hello, visitor. I am @UnusualParticle, more commonly known as Donovan. This is my personal GitHub repo that I used for projects I'm working on, whether for school or pleasure. I have recorded all my past projects here so that I can learn from my mistakes and see how I've improved. *Also so that I can reuse or consult previous code that I've written.*

## Intersets

I have a variety of interests, both professionally and recreationally.

+ Academic
  + Mathematics
    + But like actually
    + It's so elegant, the way God made all this.
    + I love exploring it.
  + Physics
    + Yes, I know, more math
    + But this math is more applied
  + Engineering
    + Math, is that you again?
    + This is just applied physics. Double-applied math. Neat.
+ Profesional
  + Maintenance
    + Eh, more of a skill. But it can be fun. 
    + Besides, this is like 95% of what we do anyway.
  + Documentation
    + Listen I know it's wierd but I love reading and making good documentation
  + Programming
    + Obviously. Why else would I be here?
+ Recreational
  + Video Games
    + Destiny 2 is my go-to
    + Skyrim
      + Currently have 163 mods installed
      + Mostly visual stuff
    + Smash Brothers (I like Ultimate, but I understand the Melee fanbase)
    + Legend of Zelda (My favorite is OoT)
    + Minecraft
  + Table Top Games
    + Dungeons and Dragons
    + Here to Slay
    + Uno
      + What? Sometimes it's good to play a simple game
  + Music
    + I play Guitar
    + Black Veil Brides
    + Angel Vivaldi
    + MercyMe
    + And so many others

## Knowledge

I've learned a lot, but there is so much more that I don't know.

### What I know

+ Schooling
  + High School in 2017
    + Electives include:
    + CAD 3D modeling software training
    + Basic programming class (Web languages, some C# stuff in Unity)
  + Technical Certificates in Industrial Technology in 2019
    + Mechanics
    + Wiring
    + Hydraulics
    + PLCs - Programmable Logic Controllers (Ladder Logic)
+ Work Experience
  + Kroger from 2015-2019
    + Nothing special here
    + Just customer service stuff
  + Die Cast Factory from 2019-current
    + More PLC stuff
    + More Wiring stuff
    + Some Mechanics stuff
    + Some Hydraulic stuff
+ Hobby Experience
  + Javascript from 2012-2021
    + First programming language
    + Eventually started to build a physics engine
    + Decided it was the wrong language
    + Never got into any of the frameworks
  + C++ from 2021
    + The love of my life
      + Low level memory management
      + High level programming techniques
      + Super fast
      + Yes please
    + Mostly personal projects
    + Some school projects

### What I'm Learning or Want to Learn

+ Schooling
  + Associate of Science in Computer Science in 2023
  + Associate of Science in Software Development in 2024
+ Work
  + Even more PLC stuff
  + Reading documentation
  + Tracking projects and changes
+ Hobby
  + Learning to define/use an API
    + Like what actually is an API
    + Is it how to communicate with a program specifically via messages or via ports or IP
      + Subnote: what is networking
    + Does it include how to format file that are fed into a program
    + Is it limited to .json
    + I'm frankly quite lost. And scared.
  + Building a game engine
    + There is so much that goes into this
    + Like what are events
    + How do they get passed and handled smoothly and efficiently
    + And why do I have the overwhelming urge to build tools for the tools for the tools
  + Maybe learn to make a Skyrim mod
    + Super on the back burner
    + Probably never getting touched
  + Submitting to an Open-Source Project
    + How do I do this
    + It scares me
  + Properly using forks in GitHub
    + Because I've only worked on personal projects, I've not had to practice pushing/pulling/merging forks and waht not

## Projects

I have... a *few* projects. Mostly one truly ambitious project that will take me years though.

### LearnCPP

This "project" is just a record of me initial learning of C++ via [LearnCPP](https://www.learncpp.com). Great resource, loved using it to learn. I'm proud to say I've since moved on and now use [C++ Reference](https://www.cppreference.com) for my language research needs.
The curriculum is split into chapters focused on topics, each of which are split into lessons, many of which have exercises at the end. This project is a record of my "submissions" to the exercises. Sadly, Instead of being split into projects, it is split into header files. Truly a mess. I didn't know how to set up multiple projects in Visual Studio yet.

### Computer

This project is the start of my efforts to simulate a basic computer down to the individual CMOS-style transisters. I started this as an exercise to force myself to become familiar with the low level logic of the gates and how they are used to make the processors the run the programs we use today. Suffice to say, I haven't gotten very far.

### Sorry! Board Game

This is a simple (horrible) version of Sorry! as a computer program according to the specs given by the CSCI 101 class curriculum. I used the SFML library to give it a GUI, which was far beyond the requirements of the project.

### Deck RPG

This project is my baby. It has gone through multiple iterations as I learn mor of what I expect from the game and the techniques required to pull it off. It is still deep under development, without even a functional alpha. I intend to have tools for game creation, from levels to items to effects. I want to impliment an event system to allow a broad variety of effects to be implimented.

### CSCI 201

This project is just record of my submissions to projects in the named class. I wrote way too many menus for this class; it was exhausting.

### Untitled RPG

This project is substantially different from the Deck RPG mentioned above. It is very simple, and not very well balanced at the moment. Just a simple turn based game; basically a bunch of pokemon-style battles with some money and inventory management. Supposed to take about 1.5 hours to ge through a full run.
